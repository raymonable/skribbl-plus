  Skribbl Plus

### A custom electron-based desktop client for skribbl, designed for devices without keyboards

In other words, Skribbl, but for a very specific use case.

#### Pros:
 - automatically starts in fullscreen
 - has an exit button at all times
 - adds a virtual keyboard to make it not require a real keyboard
 - uses skribbl website
 - gives everyone cute little horns whether you want them or not
#### Cons:
 - doesn't patch `game.js`
 - could combust at any moment
 - automatically starts in fullscreen
 - you need a keyboard to set a nickname
 - completely unnecessary
 
### What is the use case?

Raspberry Pi 4, hooked up to a drawing tablet (with a display) that I can use in bed.

That's *it*.

And yes, I know that the name is all over the place in the code.
I do not care, it works.
